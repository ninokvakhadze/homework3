      <h4>
        Ford is a family company, one that spans the globe and has shared
        ideals. We value service to each other and the world as much as to our
        customers. Generations have made their memories with us and included us
        in their hopes and dreams. After 117 years, we’re used to adapting to
        and leading change. That’s why we’re evolving to focus on services,
        experiences and software as well as vehicles.
